// Admin: Add your knowledge base content here
const KNOWLEDGE_BASE = `
 Here is the knowledge base your will refer when an employee asks you different technical and general questions regarding  social media manager job role. You should refer to these instructions but you may also use your existing knowledge and creativity when something is not found in this knowledge base : ==> 

  
1. Creating Multiple Accounts (IG, Twitter, TikTok)
a. Use a Mobile Device
You must create and operate these accounts using a mobile device. Many essential features are only accessible through mobile apps, making this a crucial step.
b. Account Verification
To verify your accounts, follow these steps:
1. Email Verification
◦ You can use existing emails or create new ones.
◦ A total of three email accounts are sufficient for verifying all platforms.
2. Phone Number Verification
◦ SMS verification is crucial to prevent future restrictions and CAPTCHA challenges.
◦ You can use any phone number to receive the verification code.
◦ If verifying all accounts by phone isn't possible, ensure at least the first account on each platform is verified with both email and phone.
◦ Platforms like Twitter often allow multiple accounts to be verified with the same phone number.
Social media platforms require verification to confirm the accounts are managed by a human rather than an automated system.
Optional: If you have an extra mobile device, consider spreading the accounts across different phones to diversify operations.

!!! IMPORTANT NOTE
If Instagram or Twitter restricts you from creating multiple accounts in one day, this means they have a limit in place. In this case, wait and create the remaining accounts over the following days until you reach three accounts per platform.

Choosing a Username & Name
• Usernames and display names should be of English origin. • Use this tool to generate names:
https://www.namegeneratorfun.com/american
• The same names can be reused across different platforms.
Handling Account Bans
• If an account gets banned, click the appeal button—most accounts are reinstated within a day.
• If the appeal is unsuccessful, simply create a new account.
• If multiple newly created accounts get banned, continue working with the remaining accounts.
!!! CRITICAL WARNING
Do NOT follow the main Mike Web profiles with any of your created or personal accounts.
Doing so makes it easier for Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter to link your marketing accounts to our main profile, identifying them as non-personal accounts. This will:
✅ Trigger severe limitations on new accounts
✅ Increase CAPTCHA challenges
✅ Make account management extremely difficult

Adjusting Privacy Settings
After creating the accounts, change Direct Message (DM) settings to allow messages from everyone.
• Unlike Instagram, TikTok and Twitter do not have a DM request system, meaning users can't message you unless your settings are adjusted.
This version maintains all the original details but is clearer, more professional, and structured for better readability. 🚀

Profile Picture & Bio
The profile picture and bio will be provided via Discord after you successfully create accounts on all mentioned platforms.
Posting Guidelines
Important Notice for Twitter (X):
Twitter (X) may display a paywall requiring a $1 annual fee to post on their platform.
🚀 Bypass Method:
Go to Twitter Profile Settings
Change your country to the USA
This should remove the paywall restriction.
Initial Posts
Each newly created account must have 9 initial posts to appear legitimate and active.
• These posts can be uploaded on the same day.
• Images and videos for these posts will be provided via Discord.
⚠ Video Download Warning:
Do not use Instagram's built-in download tool, as it adds a copyright logo.
Instead, use third-party tools like:
🔗 https://snapinsta.app/instagram-reels-video-download or any other tool/app that you like
Content Usage Rules:
✅ Same content can be posted across different platforms (e.g., Instagram 1, TikTok 1, Twitter 1).
❌ Different content must be used within the same platform (e.g., Instagram 1 ≠ Instagram 2).
This helps prevent account bans.

Regular/Daily Posts
After the initial setup, each account should post once daily to stay active.
• Captions:
◦ You can write anything relevant to the video or leave it blank.
• Hashtags:
◦ Use 6-7 hashtags per post to maximize reach.
◦ Suggested hashtags:

 #nftartwork #opensea #nftcommunity #3dart #metaverse #crypto #memecoin #cryptoart #ai  #midjourney #aicommunity #blender3d #surrealism #3dartwork #aiart

Daily Activities
Gradual Activity Build-Up
As a Social Media Manager, you must be aware that new accounts come with strict limitations on following, liking, and engaging with content. To avoid getting flagged, we follow a 10-day warm-up period to gradually increase activity levels and maximize engagement without triggering platform restrictions.
Each platform (Instagram, TikTok, Twitter) has daily activity limits to prevent spam, especially for new accounts.
⚠️ Strictly follow the table below to stay within safe limits.
📊 Table of Daily Actions (Per Account)
Day
Follows (Twitter & TikTok)
Likes (All Platforms)

✅ After Day 10 (Full Potential Reached):
• Twitter/TikTok: ~200-230 follows per day per account
• Instagram: ~120 follows per day per account
• All Platforms: ~50 likes per day per account
📌 Why Instagram Has Lower Limits?
Instagram is more sensitive to daily follows, so the numbers are lower than Twitter/TikTok to prevent bans.

⚠️ Social Media Activity Limits You Must Follow
🚀 Following Limits (Per Hour & Day)
⚠ New accounts have strict follow limits for the first 10-15 days.
• Max follows per hour:
◦ Instagram: 20-30 follows
◦ TikTok/Twitter: 40-50 follows
• Exceeding these limits can lead to restrictions or account bans.
💡 Pro Tip: Rotate Activity Between Platforms
Instead of doing all actions at once, spread them out throughout the day to avoid being flagged as spam.

✅ Example Work Schedule (Activity Rotation)
🔹 At 10:00 AM
1. 40 actions on Instagram Account 1
2. 40 actions on Twitter Account 1
3. 40 actions on TikTok Account 1
4. 40 actions on Instagram Account 2
5. 40 actions on Twitter Account 2
6. 40 actions on TikTok Account 2
🔹 At 12:00 PM → Repeat the same steps
🔹 At 2:00 PM → Repeat again
This method allows you to complete all required daily follows/likes without hitting limits or triggering spam filters.
📌 Feel free to adjust this schedule based on your availability.

❤️ Liking Strategy (Why It's Important)
Liking posts daily helps attract new followers.
• Users see your likes, check your profile, and may follow you back.
• Just like follows, likes also have limits, so follow the daily quota to prevent bans.

🚨 What To Do If You Get Temporarily Blocked?
If Instagram/Twitter/TikTok shows a "temporary suspension" message:
✅ Reduce follows/likes by 30% for 2-3 days until normal activity resumes.
If your account is suspended and you can't log in:
✅ Look for the "APPEAL" button and submit a request.
✅ Most accounts get restored within 24 hours after appealing.

How & Where to Follow
📌 Targeted Following Strategy
1️⃣ You will follow only the audience selected by our AI algorithms.
• You cannot follow random accounts.
• The selected accounts have the highest conversion rate for leads and clients.
2️⃣ Your target profiles will be provided once your accounts are set up and have initial posts.
3️⃣ At the end of the month, we will require proof that you have followed the correct targets.
🛠️ How to Follow the Target Accounts
📌 Once we provide you with a target account:
1. Go to the target account.
2. Click on their "Followers" list.
3. Start following new users from that list until you meet your daily goal.
🚨 Each of your accounts will have ONLY ONE assigned target.
⚠️ Important!
• Do NOT mix target accounts across your IG, Twitter, or TikTok accounts.
• Each target belongs to one specific account only.
• Mixing targets could lead to duplicate follows, reducing outreach efficiency.
💡 Even though scrolling the follower list every day may seem repetitive, this is the only effective way to reach new audiences.

📊 Follow-Back Ratio
📌 Mass following typically results in a 10% follow-back rate.
✅ For every 100 follows, expect at least 10 people to follow back.
⚠️ If you're not achieving this rate, notify us immediately—it may indicate the target has too many bot accounts.

🕊️ How to Follow on Twitter (X)
Unlike Instagram and TikTok, Twitter only shows 50 followers from the "Followers" list.
To work around this, follow these steps:
📌 Step-by-Step Twitter Following Method:
1️⃣ Go to your assigned target profile.
2️⃣ Click on the "Followers" tab.
3️⃣ Open the profile of the 1st follower and follow their audience (followers).
4️⃣ Once finished, move to the 2nd follower's profile and follow their audience.
5️⃣ Repeat for the 3rd, 4th, … up to the 50th follower of the target account.
💡 This ensures you always have fresh accounts to follow without limitations.

Here is an image illustration to make things clearer

📌 Part 2: Advanced Twitter (X) Following Strategy
🔍 What to Do After Running Out of People to Follow?
✅ By the time you run out of accounts using the previous method, your "Following" list will have grown significantly.
👉 You can now start following the audience of the people you've already followed!
🛠️ Steps to Follow New Accounts from Your "Following" List:
1️⃣ Go to your profile.
2️⃣ Open the "Following" tab.
3️⃣ Start following the followers of each person on that list.
💡 This ensures a continuous flow of new accounts to follow!

🛑 How to Avoid Bot Accounts?
⚠️ Social media platforms—especially in our niche—are full of bots and fake accounts.
Here are key signs to watch out for when following or liking accounts:
🚩 Red Flags for Bot Accounts:
❌ Avoid accounts with Indian/Arabic-looking names.
• These audiences are often filled with bots and are not our target.
❌ Avoid following accounts with seductive (half-naked) female profile pictures.
• These are usually fake bot accounts.
❌ Beware of strange, autogenerated usernames.
• Example: user19239921893, user293128329819
• If many accounts have usernames like this, they are likely bots.
❌ Check the follow-back ratio.
• For every 100 follows, you should get at least 10 follow-backs.
• If you're getting significantly less, notify us immediately—your assigned target may contain too many bot accounts.

📌 6. How & Where to LIKE
🛠️ The Liking Strategy
Liking posts is just as important as following—it increases engagement and visibility.
To maximize effectiveness, we will use #hashtags to find the best posts.

📌 Step-by-Step Guide to Liking on Each Platform
✅ 1. Use the Provided Hashtag Targets
• Instagram: Go to the hashtag page and select the "Recent" filter.
• Twitter (X): Search the hashtag and select the "Latest" filter.
• TikTok: Search the hashtag, then use filters to show posts uploaded in the last month or select "Recently Uploaded."
✅ 2. Find Posts with High Engagement
• Look for posts with many comments.
• Prioritize comments that have low likes (0-10 likes).
• Liking these comments increases the chances of users noticing you.
✅ 3. Alternative Method: Liking Low-Engagement Posts
• Instead of comments, you can like posts within the provided hashtags.
• Focus on posts with 0-20 likes to ensure maximum visibility.
👉 You can choose either method—liking comments or low-like posts—to hit your daily goal!

7- DM's The most crucial part.

Hopefully you understood the following and liking process and I didn't over-complicate those simple steps.

Now we need to understand what to do with our new gained audience.

1- First of all make sure that you are following all your followers (you are mutually following each other) otherwise you wont be able to send messages.

The purpose of DMs will be to drive traffic, audience and potential costumers to our company or to clients which pay for marketing services. For now we will be advertising an e-commerce shop client.

There is a 3 STEP process in which you will engage with your new audience:

📌 STEP 1:

HERE ARE THE MESSAGE TEMPLATES ==>
Send them one of the template messages we've provided. We've included multiple variations to prevent social media platforms from flagging the messages as spam, so be sure to switch between them regularly to stay under the radar.

Version 1:
Hi, I work for Mike Web3 dev company—the minds behind hit memecoins like dogenator and pepefather. We're scouting for fresh Meme Coin ideas that really capture attention. If you have a unique concept, DM it to our main profile @mike_dev_defi. We'll handle the building and marketing for free. Your idea + our expertise = a winning Partnership.

Version 2:
Hello, I'm part of Mike Web3 development team that launched successful memecoins like dogenator and pepefather. We're now on the lookout for more innovative Meme Coin concepts. Got an idea? Send it over via DM at @mike_dev_defi. We cover development and marketing at no cost. Let's team up and create something big!

Version 3:
Hey, I work for Mike Web3 dev, a company behind profitable memecoins such as dogenator and pepefather. We're seeking new, attention-grabbing Meme Coin ideas. If you have a standout concept, DM it to our main profile @mike_dev_defi. We'll take care of the building and marketing for free. Your idea and our work—let's partner up and win big!

Version 4:
Hey! I'm with Mike Web3, the team behind viral memecoins like Dogenator and PepeFather. We're on the hunt for the next big Meme Coin idea that can take the market by storm. Got a unique concept? DM our main profile @mike_dev_defi. We'll take care of the development and marketing—100% free. Your vision + our expertise = The perfect partnership

📌 STEP 2:
⚠️ TikTok does not recognize the @username command, meaning users won't be redirected to the profile when mentioned in DMs.
🛠️ Solution: Send a Pinned Video for Higher Visibility
Immediately after sending the initial STEP 1 text message, send the 1st pinned video from @mike_dev_defi to the person you're DM-ing.
📌 Steps to Share the Pinned Video:
1️⃣ Go to @mike_dev_defi on TikTok.
2️⃣ Open the 1st pinned video.
3️⃣ Click "Share" → Select "Send to Friends" → Choose the person you just DM-ed.
✅ Why is this important?
• Ensures the recipient sees the video directly in their inbox.
• Increases the chances of engagement and response.
🚫 Skip this step for Instagram and Twitter (X), as they recognize @username mentions.

📌 STEP 3: Responding to Inquiries
If someone asks for more details about the DM proposal, redirect them to our main page using this pre-written response:
📩 "Please DM Mike Web (@mike_dev_defi) for further discussion."
This keeps communication streamlined and ensures potential leads are handled properly.

📌 STEP 8: Technical/General Assistance & Reporting

1️⃣ AI Chatbot for Technical & Work-Related Questions
To help you navigate day-to-day technical and general questions—especially during your first month—we have set up our own AI Chatbot, specifically trained for your scope of work.
